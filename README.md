# Intro
[University of Tartu](http://www.ut.ee/en) provides free on-line courses to learn Python. As I have thought already long time to get insight into it I decided to participate at those courses.
First course is [Introduction to Programming](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/2017/eprogalused/Main/HomePage) and it takes place from January 17, 2017 until March 12, 2017.

# Approach
As those courses are in estonian (including pre-defined function names sometimes for automated checks) I decided to use during programming also estonian in variable and function names, comments etc.
